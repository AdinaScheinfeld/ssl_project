# all_datasets_clip_pretrain_2_config.yaml - config file for lsm pretraining

training:
  seed: 100
  project_name: ibot-clip-pretrain-lsm-all
  max_epochs: 25000
  patience: 25000 # use early stopping with patience (set to a high value to effectively disable)
  log_every_n_steps: 5
  checkpoint_every_n_epochs: 500 # save checkpoint every n epochs

# config for distributed training
dist:
  multi_gpu: True # set to True for multi-gpu training
  accelerator: gpu # cpu/gpu/mps
  strategy: ddp # distributed data parallel (ddp) for multi-gpu training 
  # (one process per gpu where each process has its own copy of the model and optimiser; 
  # training data is split across processes and sees a unique mini-batch each step; 
  # after each forward/backward pass, gradients are averaged acrosss all gpus so models stay in sync)
  devices: 2 # number of gpus per node (set to 1 for single gpu training)
  num_nodes: 1 # set >1 for multi-node training
  precision: bf16-mixed # bf16-mixed good for h100 gpus (some parts of computation use bfloat16 for speed and memory efficiency, while others use float32 for stability)
  accumulate_grad_batches: 8 # gradient accumulation (controls how many batches to accumulate gradients over before performing an optimizer step; set to >1 for larger effective batch size)
  sync_batchnorm: True # synchronize batch norm across gpus (good for multi-gpu training)
  deterministic: False # set to True for reproducibility (may slow down training)
