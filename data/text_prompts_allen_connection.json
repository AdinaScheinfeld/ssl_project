    "c0": "In this light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image, nuclei appear as numerous small, round fluorescent dots packed throughout the tissue. Together they form a dense speckled texture that maps cell density and laminar patterns in three dimensions.",
    "c1": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging of a cleared mouse brain reveals sparse, intensely bright neurons highlighted by viral tracing. The fluorescent signal outlines individual somata and extended processes, making the morphology of projection neurons clearly distinguishable from the surrounding background.",
    "c2": "The autofluorescence channel in light-sheet microscopy produces a soft, diffuse glow across the cleared tissue. Rather than marking specific cells, this broad signal outlines gross anatomical features and boundaries, serving as a structural reference for the dataset."
