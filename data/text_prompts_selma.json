    "ab_plaque": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image patch of a cleared 5xFAD transgenic mouse brain labeled for amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques. The staining produces dense, bright fluorescent deposits scattered throughout the parenchyma, with rounded or irregularly shaped aggregates. These extracellular plaques appear as high-contrast puncta and clusters in the 640 nm channel, marking hallmark Alzheimer's disease pathology in cortical and hippocampal regions.",
    "cfos": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image patch of a cleared mouse brain immunolabeled for the activity-dependent protein c-Fos. The antibody staining yields bright punctate nuclear signals marking recently activated neurons. In the 640 nm channel, c-Fos-positive cells appear as distinct, sharply outlined nuclei distributed across cortical and subcortical regions, standing out against a dark background of unstained tissue.",
    "chondrocytes": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image patch of a cleared human embryo head (PCW7-11) immunolabeled for Collagen II. The signal appears as bright, continuous mesh-like fluorescence outlining cartilage matrix and surrounding chondrocytes. Collagen II-positive structures form well-organized bands and sheets of signal in developing cranial cartilage, with a dense, glowing extracellular pattern that contrasts with adjacent unlabeled tissue.",
    "chondrogenic_cells": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image patch of a cleared human embryo head (PCW5-11) immunolabeled for Sox9. Sox9-positive progenitors appear as clusters of brightly fluorescent nuclei within mesenchymal condensations. The signal is punctate and localized to nuclear regions, highlighting early chondrogenic cell populations before cartilage matrix formation, with sharp contrast against surrounding mesenchyme.",
    "nucleus": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image patch of a post-mortem adult human brain cleared with the SHANEL protocol and stained with propidium iodide (PI). The nuclei appear as bright, sharply defined red spheres or ovals, densely distributed across both gray and white matter. The PI signal creates a speckled fluorescent pattern where each glowing dot corresponds to an individual nucleus, enabling three-dimensional mapping of cell density across thick tissue.",
    "vessel_eb": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image patch of a cleared adult mouse brain labeled with Evans Blue (EB). EB staining produces intensely bright, tubular fluorescence confined to large-caliber blood vessels. The dye fills arteries and veins, appearing as thick, glowing red tracks through the tissue, with high signal intensity in major vessels such as the middle cerebral artery and circle of Willis.",
    "vessel_wga": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image patch of a cleared adult mouse brain perfused with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594. The WGA staining highlights microvessels and capillaries as fine, thread-like fluorescent networks spreading densely through the parenchyma. In the 561 nm channel, these thin glowing filaments form a delicate, lace-like pattern that reveals the dense microvascular bed at high resolution."
