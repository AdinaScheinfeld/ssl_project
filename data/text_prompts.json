    "01_aa1-po-c-r45": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy patch from a cleared adult wildtype (WT) mouse brain. Tissue was immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of dopaminergic neurons. Fluorescence was captured in the 639 nm channel. TH signal is localized to the cytoplasm of neuronal soma, producing intense, homogeneous labeling of dopaminergic cells. This image highlights detailed cellular morphology within the brain region.",
    "02_az10-sr3b-6_a": "3D light-sheet microscopy image patch acquired from a cleared wildtype adult mouse brain. Immunolabeling for CTIP2, a nuclear transcription factor involved in cortical neuron differentiation, was performed and visualized using the 561 nm fluorescence channel. CTIP2 staining reveals nuclear-localized puncta within deep-layer projection neurons, with clearly defined nuclear boundaries and dense labeling patterns.",
    "03_aj12-lg1e-n_a": "Volumetric fluorescence image from an adult WT mouse brain section stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament protein expressed in astrocytes. The tissue was imaged using light-sheet microscopy in the 639 nm channel. GFAP signal is distributed throughout the astrocytic cytoplasm and processes, producing a filamentous pattern that outlines astrocyte morphology and highlights the fine arborization of glial networks.",
    "04_ae2-wf2a_a": "High-resolution light-sheet image patch from a cleared WT mouse brain, immunolabeled for the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. Fluorescence signal was captured in the 639 nm channel. p75NTR is expressed in both the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of certain neurons and glial cells. The staining reveals membrane-associated fluorescence outlining cell boundaries and diffuse cytoplasmic signal, consistent with p75NTR localization in neurogenic regions.",
    "05_ch1-pcw1a_a": "Light-sheet fluorescence image patch of an adult WT mouse brain showing immunolabeling for dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), an enzyme involved in norepinephrine synthesis. Signal was acquired in the 639 nm channel. DBH is localized to the cytoplasm and synaptic vesicles of noradrenergic neurons. This image highlights punctate and cytoplasmic fluorescence, reflecting DBH’s role in vesicular catecholamine transport and storage.",
    "06_az10-sr3b-6_a": "Fluorescent nuclear staining in a cleared adult WT mouse brain, acquired using light-sheet microscopy. The DNA-binding dye SYTO 24 was used to label cell nuclei and was imaged in the 488 nm channel. The resulting pattern shows uniform, high-contrast labeling of nuclei throughout the tissue volume, facilitating identification of cell density and spatial organization across cortical and subcortical regions.",
    "07_az10-sr3b-6_a": "Sparse neuronal labeling in a WT adult mouse brain, visualized via expression of cytoplasmic green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a pAAV viral vector. Acquired using light-sheet microscopy in the 639 nm channel, this patch contains isolated, fully labeled neuron soma and processes. The cytoplasmic GFP signal allows clear visualization of neuronal morphology and trajectory within descending motor pathways."
