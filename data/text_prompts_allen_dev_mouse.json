    "Artery": "In this 3D light-sheet microscopy reconstruction of a cleared mouse brain, arteries emerge as broad, glowing tubes that branch into finer arterioles. The signal traces the hierarchical vascular tree, with thick trunks splitting into smaller fluorescent paths coursing through the parenchyma.",
    "Background": "Cleared mouse brain tissue imaged by light-sheet microscopy shows faint, diffuse autofluorescence. Instead of sharp puncta or filaments, the background glow outlines gross anatomy and cortical layering, providing soft contrast that situates the brighter labeled structures.",
    "Background2": "Cleared mouse brain tissue imaged by light-sheet microscopy shows faint, diffuse autofluorescence. Instead of sharp puncta or filaments, the background glow outlines gross anatomy and cortical layering, providing soft contrast that situates the brighter labeled structures.",
    "Lectin": "Lectin staining of vasculature in a 3D LSFM dataset produces delicate, lace-like threads running throughout the brain. Microvessels and capillaries appear as intricate glowing filaments, weaving a dense vascular web across cortical and subcortical regions.",
    "Microtubule": "Microtubule labeling in light-sheet fluorescence microscopy reveals a filamentous scaffold within neurons. Fine fluorescent fibers extend along axons and dendrites, forming an intricate mesh of glowing cytoskeletal tracks that captures the internal framework of neural processes.",
    "Neurofilament": "Axonal architecture is highlighted by neurofilament staining, which appears in LSFM images as thick, fibrous fluorescent strands interlaced with thinner fibers. Together they form bright, elongated tracts that map out long-range neuronal projections across the brain.",
    "Neurotrace": "NeuroTrace labeling marks neuronal somata, producing bright, rounded signals scattered through gray matter. In three dimensions, the stain forms a dense constellation of glowing cell bodies, emphasizing laminar distribution and separating neuronal populations from surrounding tissue.",
    "Pericyte": "NeuroTrace labeling marks neuronal somata, producing bright, rounded signals scattered through gray matter. In three dimensions, the stain forms a dense constellation of glowing cell bodies, emphasizing laminar distribution and separating neuronal populations from surrounding tissue.",
    "Syto16": "Syto16 nuclear staining produces a cloud of tiny, brilliant points filling the tissue volume. Each nucleus glows as a distinct dot, and together they create a fine speckled texture that reveals overall cell density and cortical laminar patterns in 3D reconstructions."
