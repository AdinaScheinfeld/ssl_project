    "calretinin": "In this light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image of a cleared human cortical slice (BA44/45), calretinin-positive interneurons are visible. The staining produces bright punctate somata with delicate fluorescent processes, giving rise to a sparse, scattered pattern of glowing cells concentrated in superficial cortical layers.",
    "gad67": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image patch of a cleared human cortical slice labeled for GAD67, a marker of GABAergic neurons. The staining produces bright cytoplasmic fluorescence filling neuronal somata and proximal processes, creating a scattered constellation of glowing inhibitory neurons that outlines the distribution of the cortical GABAergic network.",
    "neun": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image patch of a SWITCH/TDE-cleared human cortical section immunolabeled for NeuN. The marker generates intense nuclear and perinuclear fluorescence, revealing dense fields of glowing neuronal cell bodies across cortical laminae, with sharp contrast between gray and white matter.",
    "nuclei": "The nuclear stain in this light-sheet fluorescence microscopy image of cleared human brain tissue produces numerous small, round fluorescent signals. Each nucleus appears as a tiny glowing sphere, generating a fine-grained, speckled pattern of high density in cortical laminae and reduced density in underlying white matter.",
    "somatostatin": "Somatostatin-positive interneurons are highlighted in this 3D light-sheet reconstruction of a cleared human cortex slice. The antibody staining yields bright, isolated fluorescent cell bodies in deeper cortical layers, often accompanied by faint dendritic extensions, creating a sparse but distinct distribution of inhibitory neurons within the tissue."
